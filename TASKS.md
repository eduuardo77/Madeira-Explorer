# Tasks

Ordered implementation checklist with explicit dependencies.

**Document date:** 2026-08-06
**Last updated:** 2026-08-11 — T-105 split into **T-105a** (the souvenir *composition*, done,
D-042) and **T-105b** (the encoder, which needs a device); **T-117** the dependency network
audit done statically (`docs/dependency-audit.md`, D-043), adding **T-117b** for the on-device
half; **T-124** the privacy policy (D-044); **T-046** the battery exemption (D-045); **T-070**
the stamp artwork (D-046); **T-113**'s contrast half, which found three shipped failures;
**T-118** the Apple privacy manifest; **T-116**/**T-116a** the notification budget and the
island's name out of `app/`; **T-120**/**T-122** the store privacy answers; **T-113** closed by measuring every screen;
**T-139** the dark style tuned by contrast, and **T-140** wired to the map.
Previously 2026-08-10 — **v1 is
feature-complete in code.** That day closed T-034,
T-039/T-040 (D-033/D-034), T-049, T-056–T-059 (D-035/D-036), T-071–T-075, T-081, T-099–T-104
(D-039/D-040), T-114/T-121 and T-125/T-140/T-141, and added a web design workbench (D-038).
It also found that **erase-all had been silently broken since migration 2**.
Previously 2026-08-08 — v1 scope cut (D-032); tile schema (D-030); visual direction and
passport structure (D-026, D-027); activity gating (D-028); D-022 confirmed.

> **v1 = record → stamps by geofence → draw the trace → passport → souvenir.**
> Phases 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. **Phase 4 is v2.** See D-032.
**Overall progress:** the whole v1 chain is written and **nothing has run on real hardware.**
What remains: T-105b (the souvenir *encoder* — its composition is now written), a short tail of
small items, verification that needs a device, and the curated content. See `HANDOFF.md`.

⚠ **Everything marked done below is verified by typecheck, bundle, 270 unit tests over the
pure logic, and — for the screens — measurement in a browser (D-038).** No fix has ever been
recorded, no permission dialog seen, no battery figure measured, and no map rendered on a GPU.
Real-device testing is mandatory for anything touching recording (CONTEXT §6.6) and is what
T-051–T-055 exist for.

Task IDs are stable — reference them in commits and never renumber. Dependencies are listed
as `⇠ T-xxx`. A task must not start until all its dependencies are done.

This list is kept current as work happens and as decisions change the plan — see the
maintenance protocol in [CONTEXT.md §9](CONTEXT.md). A decision that changes the architecture
almost always changes tasks and dependencies here too.

## Phase P — Planning and definition

- [x] **T-001** Define product concept, audience and core loop
- [x] **T-002** Critique the concept; identify the slow-fill / dark-map retention risk
- [x] **T-003** Survey prior art (Wandrer, CityStrides, Fog of World, Polarsteps, AllTrails,
      Wikiloc) and confirm technical feasibility
- [x] **T-004** Decide the canvas model — curated places over island-wide road coverage
      ⇠ T-002
- [x] **T-005** Decide the reward metaphor — passport stamps over stars ⇠ T-004
- [x] **T-006** Settle the battery strategy (batching, activity gating, geofences, burst
      matching)
- [x] **T-007** Settle the mobile-data strategy (bundle the island offline)
- [x] **T-008** Settle the privacy architecture (no backend, zero networked dependencies)
      ⇠ T-007
- [x] **T-009** Design the "ghost app" resilience model (OS-survival, day-1 health check, two
      notifications)
- [x] **T-010** Design the low-signal matching strategy (tunnels, levada corridors, barometer,
      pedometer, generosity rule) ⇠ T-006
- [x] **T-011** Decide the distribution strategy — organic sharing of the souvenir video
- [x] **T-012** Write project documentation (README, PROJECT_PLAN, ARCHITECTURE, TASKS,
      DECISIONS, CONTEXT) ⇠ T-001…T-011

### Still open in this phase

- [x] **T-013** Decide framework (OD-1) — **resolved 2026-08-06: React Native** with
      `@maplibre/maplibre-react-native` v11 and Expo tooling (D-023). **Phase 1 unblocked.**
      ⇠ T-013a
- [x] **T-013a** Research MapLibre and geolocation plugin maturity in RN vs Flutter —
      **done 2026-08-06.** Surfaced the `setFeatureState` finding (D-004 revision, D-022),
      which mattered more than the framework question itself.
- [x] **T-014** Decide whether Porto Santo is in scope (OD-2) — **resolved 2026-08-06:
      included structurally, deliberately deprioritised editorially** (D-021)
- [x] **T-015** Confirm the hero number (OD-3) — **resolved 2026-08-06: places/stamps**
      (D-002 Accepted)
- [x] **T-016** Decide raw-trace retention policy (OD-6) — **resolved 2026-08-06: retain**
      (D-010 Accepted)
- [x] **T-016b** Confirm whether Phase 0 fieldwork is locally available — **resolved
      2026-08-06: project lead lives in Madeira.** Sequencing unchanged; see CONTEXT.md §5a
- [x] **T-016a** Confirm D-022 (overlay rendering rather than feature state) — **confirmed by
      the project lead 2026-08-08. D-022 is Accepted.**
- [x] **T-016d** Settle the visual direction and primary-screen structure — **resolved
      2026-08-08:** two styles, light for use and dark for the souvenir (D-026); passport by
      category (D-027); three-control layout. Written up in `docs/design-brief.md`.
      **All three decisions are Provisional** until validated against real tiles (T-025).
- [x] **T-016c** Decide on the Transistor Soft licence — **resolved 2026-08-06: not purchased.**
      Start free on `expo-location`; buy only if T-051–T-054 fail (D-025)

## Phase 0 — Validation

Cheap answers to expensive questions. Nothing here requires the app to exist.

### Field GPS reality check

> **Track A procedure — logger, both runs, ground truth, the sampling-bias warning — is in
> [`docs/field-testing.md`](docs/field-testing.md).** The tasks below track it; that document
> says how to actually do it.

- [ ] **T-017** Obtain a raw sensor logger — **do not build one.** Use **Sensor Logger**
      (Kelvin Choi, iOS + Android): records GPS fix/accuracy/speed/heading/altitude, barometer
      and pedometer in one time-aligned session, exports CSV/JSON/SQLite. Paid tier is needed
      for combined CSV export and the barometric-altitude/pedometer channels. Tooling and
      sample parsing code at github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger.
- [ ] **T-017a** Capture ground truth alongside each run: take a **photo** at each key waypoint
      (trailhead, tunnel portals, exit). EXIF gives timestamp + location for free, which is what
      the recorded trace gets compared against.
- [ ] **T-018** Walk one full levada under Laurissilva canopy with the logger ⇠ T-017
- [ ] **T-019** Drive one tunnel-heavy VR1/VE1 route with the logger ⇠ T-017
- [ ] **T-020** Analyse and document blackout durations, error magnitudes, whether the
      barometer survives tunnels and canopy, whether altitude separates the VR1 from the
      coastal ER101, and whether the pedometer keeps counting through blackouts. Write to
      `docs/field-notes.md`. ⇠ T-018, T-019
- [ ] **T-021** Commit the traces to `tools/fixtures/` as the permanent matching regression
      suite ⇠ T-018, T-019
- [ ] **T-021a** **Repeat at least one run on a mid-range Android device.** The project lead's
      iPhone 15 has better GNSS than much of what tourists actually carry, so iPhone-only
      fixtures are best-case. Tuning corridor widths and gap thresholds against them risks an
      app that under-credits on cheaper hardware. Sensor Logger is cross-platform, so the same
      procedure applies. ⇠ T-018, T-019

### Tile pipeline spike

- [x] **T-022** Obtain an OSM extract of Madeira **and Porto Santo** (D-021)
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-022)
- [x] **T-023** Build a reproducible tile generation script producing PMTiles or MBTiles ⇠ T-022
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-023)
- [ ] **T-024** Verify stable OSM way IDs survive into the rendered tiles. **Downgraded from
      "critical" by D-022** — useful as an internal join key, no longer architecturally
      load-bearing. ⇠ T-023
- [ ] **T-025** Prove overlay rendering: a MapLibre demo drawing a highlighted road segment
      from *local* geometry on top of the basemap, and confirm it aligns with the basemap's own
      road rendering (D-022) ⇠ T-023
- [ ] **T-025a** Evaluate suppressing basemap road rendering entirely and drawing all roads —
      visited and unvisited — from the local overlay, which makes alignment a non-issue by
      construction ⇠ T-025
      — ⚠ **Measured 2026-08-08 (T-028): this means rendering ~51,000 highway ways**, before any
      splitting at intersections — not the ~5,000 implied elsewhere. D-022 names this as the
      escape hatch for the alignment risk; it is not the cheap one it reads as. Measure before
      committing.
      — **But it need not be all-or-nothing.** T-026a found the basemap cannot distinguish a
      levada path from any other footpath (names are stripped from `transportation`). Drawing
      **only levada paths** from our own overlay is **~1,386 ways** — ~3% of the full cost, aimed
      at the one feature the product is about. Evaluate this scoped version first.
      — Cheaper still, worth eyeballing before building anything: the *named* `waterway` channel
      runs parallel to the path within a few metres, so rendering it may read as "the levada" at
      most zooms with no overlay at all.
- [~] **T-026** Record tile pack size and judge it acceptable for a hotel-WiFi download ⇠ T-023
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-026)
- [x] **T-026a** Verify the tile schema actually carries Madeira's defining features
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-026a)
- [ ] **T-027** ~~Decision gate on T-024~~ **Removed by D-022.** The fog-of-war fallback is no
      longer contingent on the tile pipeline preserving OSM IDs.

### Content feasibility

- [x] **T-028** Assess OSM levada coverage and quality; decide whether official PR-route data
      must be reconciled in, and confirm licensing (OD-7)
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-028)
- [ ] **T-028b** Install WalkMe and look at it — the direct competitor (`docs/competitors.md`).
      Its map is app-only, so cartography, trail rendering and the offline download flow could
      not be inspected from the web. One afternoon, on the island. ⇠ nothing
- [ ] **T-028a** Field-verify the OSM levada data. Counts prove the data exists, not that it is
      accurate. Walk one known levada and compare against OSM: corridor **connectivity** (a gap
      mid-corridor breaks trailhead-to-exit crediting), tunnel **portal-node precision**, and
      whether the PR relations are current. Fold into a Track A run — same afternoon, same
      device. ⇠ T-018

**Milestone M0** — assumptions validated ⇠ T-020, T-025, T-026, T-028

---

## Phase 1 — The recorder

**Blocked until T-013 (framework decision).**

### Foundations

- [~] **T-029** Scaffold an Expo + React Native project **in TypeScript** (CONTEXT.md §6.7);
      set up iOS and Android dev builds. Note background location requires a development build,
      not Expo Go. ⇠ T-013
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-029)
- [x] **T-029b** Stand up the portable Android emulator so the app can be *seen*
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-029b)
- [x] **T-030** Implement the SQLite schema (raw_fix, sensor_sample, geofence_event, trip)
      with WAL mode ⇠ T-029, T-016
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-030)
- [x] **T-030a** Define a `LocationProvider` interface so the recording backend can be swapped
      without touching matching, storage or presentation (D-025) ⇠ T-029
- [x] **T-031** Integrate **`expo-location`** (free) behind `LocationProvider` (D-025)
      ⇠ T-030a — code complete, never yet run on hardware.
- [ ] **T-031a** *Contingency only:* swap in the Transistor Soft SDK if any of T-051–T-054
      fail. Do not purchase before that evidence exists. ⇠ T-051, T-052, T-053, T-054
- [x] **T-032** Set iOS Data Protection class to `CompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` and
      configure Android app-private storage ⇠ T-030
- [~] **T-032a** Backup policy (ARCHITECTURE.md §4a): **include** the SQLite database,
      **exclude** the tile pack. iOS `isExcludedFromBackup`; Android manifest backup rules.
      Exceeding Android's auto-backup cap can silently fail the *whole* backup, losing the
      user's trip history. ⇠ T-032, T-057
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-032a)

### Capture

- [~] **T-033** Implement batched location delivery — iOS deferred updates, Android
      `setMaxWaitTime` ⇠ T-031
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-033)
- [x] **T-034** Implement **stationary-vs-moving** sampling gating (D-028) ⇠ T-031
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-034)
- [ ] **T-034a** *Deferred:* revisit walking-vs-driving gating once T-020 shows whether the
      distinction pays for itself. If it does, the Android answer is a dedicated step-counter or
      activity-recognition dependency — costing a new dependency (§6.4) **and** an
      `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` runtime permission. Do not spend either on a guess. ⇠ T-020, T-034
- [x] **T-035** Capture barometer / relative altitude alongside GPS ⇠ T-030
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-035)
- [~] **T-036** Capture pedometer step counts alongside GPS ⇠ T-030
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-036)
- [x] **T-037** Immediate incremental flush on every batch — never hold a day in memory
      ⇠ T-030, T-033
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-037)
- [ ] **T-038** Sampling policy tuned against Phase 0 field data ⇠ T-020, T-033, T-034

### Geofence backbone

- [x] **T-039** Implement the dynamic geofence manager — nearest ~18 registered plus one large
      "left this area" trigger that reshuffles the set (iOS 20-region cap) ⇠ T-031
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-039)
- [x] **T-040** Load geofence definitions from the content pack, not from code ⇠ T-039, T-014
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-040)
- [x] **T-041** Persist geofence enter/exit/dwell events ⇠ T-039, T-030
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-041)

### Permissions and survival

- [x] **T-042** Permission flow: While-Using first and **fully functional**, with explicit
      start/end recording mode ⇠ T-031
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-042)
- [x] **T-043** Deferred "Always" upgrade request, timed for ~day 2 ⇠ T-042
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-043)
- [x] **T-044** Detect iOS Always → While-Using downgrade and prompt gently for recovery
      ⇠ T-043
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-044)
- [ ] **T-045** Android foreground service with the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` type
      ⇠ T-031
- [x] **T-046** Android battery-optimisation exemption request ⇠ T-045
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-046)
- [ ] **T-047** iOS region monitoring + significant-location-change as the
      termination-survival backbone (survives force-quit) ⇠ T-039
- [~] **T-048** Service health monitor and gap annotation ⇠ T-037
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-048)
- [x] **T-049** Day-1 self-check (12–24h after install) verifying recording actually happened
      ⇠ T-048
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-049)
- [x] **T-072a** Per-category progress computation (D-027) — the passport's primary axis
      ⇠ T-066, T-071
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-072a)
- [x] **T-073** Per-region progress computation ⇠ T-067, T-071
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-073)
- [x] **T-050** Debug screen: raw fix count, last fix time, gaps, permission state, service
      health ⇠ T-048
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-050)

### Verification

- [x] **T-052a** ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-08-12 — the recorder records. It was never broken (D-047).**
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-052a)
- [~] **T-052b** Detect a recorder that is running but receiving nothing ⇠ T-052a, T-049
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-052b)
- [x] **T-052c** ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-08-12 — and it was not what it looked like (D-048).**
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-052c)
- [x] **T-142** ✅ **FIXED 2026-08-14 — `Cannot use shared object that was already released`.**
      One retry, for one error signature, applied once at the handle rather than at thirty call
      sites. The rejection happens *before the statement executes*, which is the whole of the
      safety argument and is why the predicate matching it is deliberately narrow.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-142)

- [x] **T-148** Housekeeping, 2026-08-15. 2.9 GB of regenerable Gradle output removed, screenshots
      pruned to the six that show current state, a stray `metro.log` untracked. **The checkout is
      ~12 GB and none of it is the app** — the breakdown, what is safe to delete and what only
      looks safe are in `docs/dev-build.md`. Two unused test seams deleted.

### Settings, polished — 2026-08-15

- [x] **T-147** **Google's own dark map, where the device can draw it.** The project lead asked to
      keep it OEM; the app was drawing an authored style on every device instead.
      — ⚠ **`colorScheme: DARK` needs the latest Maps renderer**, and nothing in `expo-maps` ever
      asks Play services for it — the log said `preferredRenderer: null`.
      `plugins/withLatestMapsRenderer.js` now asks in `Application.onCreate`, which is the
      documented way and has to happen before any map exists.
      — ⚠ **Asking is not getting.** This emulator asks for LATEST and is handed **LEGACY**: Play
      services there does not have the new renderer. So the app records what it actually got and
      chooses from that (`map/mapsRenderer.ts` → `map/darkMode.ts`) — Google's dark map where it
      works, the authored one where it cannot. Nobody gets a white map after choosing dark.
      — The renderer reaches JavaScript as **one word in a file**, written by the SDK's own
      callback. A native module for that would be a bridge, a registration and a package to keep
      alive across Expo upgrades, to carry a string that changes once per launch.
      — ⚠ Needed `play-services-maps` declared in the app module: `expo-maps` keeps it as an
      `implementation` dependency, so `MapsInitializer` is not on the consuming classpath.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-147)



- [x] **T-146** Background tracking, its three tiers, *Start walk*, a drawn settings icon, and a
      dark map that is actually dark. The project lead's list of 2026-08-15.
      — **Tiers are named, not priced** (D-060). Asked for as *~3% / medium / ~15–20%*; they ship
      as Battery saver / Balanced / Best detail because no battery figure here has ever been
      measured and D-041 exists for that reason.
      — ⚠ **Dark mode needed two implementations.** `colorScheme: DARK` is a *latest-renderer*
      feature and Play services loads the **legacy** renderer on plenty of devices, this emulator
      included, where it is ignored in silence. An authored night style
      (`map/googleNightStyle.ts`) works on both.
      — ⚠ **And it took the settings button with it**: the chrome measured 1.13:1 on the night
      map against 15.36:1 on the light one. A hairline border on the dark map only, with the
      number pinned by a test.
      — **A third missing seam, same family as T-145**: nothing had ever started recording for a
      user who granted Always, and those users are shown no start button by design. Fixed in
      `syncRecordingWithPreferences`.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-146). Decision: **D-060**.

### ⚠⚠ Found 2026-08-14 — no stamp could ever have been awarded

- [x] **T-145** ✅ **Nothing in the app ever started geofence monitoring.** `refreshGeofences`
      had exactly one caller: the debug screen. On a user's phone the sequence was install →
      grant permission → press record → walk to a miradouro → **collect nothing, for ever**,
      with a diary full of healthy-looking location batches and no error anywhere.
      — **Why nothing caught it.** Every part works and is tested: `geofenceManager`,
      `geofenceSelection`, the stamp rules, the content pack, and `index.ts` really does register
      the catalogue (T-040). The *seam* between "recording started" and "monitor these places"
      was never joined, and a seam is exactly what unit tests cannot see.
      — **Why the emulator never showed it either.** Every session that ever saw a geofence fire
      had started monitoring by hand from the debug screen — which registers the **synthetic
      fixture**, so the events carried `dev-near-*` ids. The dev tool was standing in for the
      missing wiring and hiding it at the same time.
      — **How it was found.** By trying to earn a stamp: a replayed route that arrives at Forte
      de São Tiago and stands there for four minutes awarded nothing, and the diary had no
      `geofence` line at all since the database was erased.
      — **The fix** is `recording/tripRecording.ts`: `startTrip`/`stopTrip` pair the two halves so
      they cannot be started separately again, and `ensureGeofencesIfRecording` re-registers on
      launch — ⚠ **Android drops every geofence when the phone reboots**, which would have been
      the same silent failure arriving a second way.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-145)

### ⚠ Found 2026-08-14 — the trace was drawn across water it could not have crossed

- [x] **T-143** ✅ **The highlighted line was wrong, twice over, and the second one was ours.**
      The map joined two fixes 900 km apart into one straight stroke (now D-059), *and* the test
      route was 245 m out to sea. Both are fixed and both are pinned by tests.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-143)

- [x] **T-144** ✅ **Passport categories swipe; "See all" expands one into the grid.**
      The project lead's instruction of 2026-08-14. Five wrapped grids of 80 places was one very
      long page; five strips is one and a half screens with the hero still on it.

## Phase 2 — Offline map rendering

> ### ⚠ Superseded as the shipping path, 2026-08-14 (D-057)
> The app draws **Google Maps on Android** now, and Apple Maps on iOS when there is an iOS build.
> Everything below was built, works, and is **kept rather than deleted** at the project lead's
> instruction — `app/src/map/MapLibreScreen.tsx` and the whole `tiles/` pipeline. It is the answer
> if offline, privacy or the dark souvenir style ever outranks looking native.
>
> **What this means for the tasks below:** T-056–T-062 and T-139/T-140 stay done. **T-063b is
> moot** (nothing fetches glyphs). **T-064** (recolour the real graph) and **T-065** (outdoor
> sunlight legibility) no longer gate v1 — they judge a renderer that is not shipping — but T-065's
> *question* survives in a new form: is **Google's** map legible in Funchal at midday?

- [x] **T-056** Integrate MapLibre GL Native ⇠ T-029, T-025
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-056)
- [x] **T-057** Bundle or WiFi-gated first-run download of the tile pack ⇠ T-026, T-056
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-057)
- [x] **T-058** Author the **light** base style — the everyday in-app map (D-026). Start from an
      existing permissively-licensed style (Protomaps basemap theme, or CARTO Positron over an
      OpenMapTiles-schema build) and **subtract**: strip labels, mute roads, quiet the water and
      landcover so the trace can dominate. **Do not author from a blank file.** Verify the
      starting style's licence. Minimal labels — city names and major cultural landmarks only.
      ⇠ T-056
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-058)
- [x] **T-058a** Add **shaded terrain** as the figure-ground element instead of building
      footprints (D-026). Madeira's relief is the island's defining feature and OSM building
      coverage is patchy outside Funchal. Record the tile-size cost against T-026. ⇠ T-058, T-023
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-058a)
- [x] **T-059** **v1: draw the recorded raw trace** as a line layer from `raw_fix` (D-032) —
      not matched segments. Simplify for rendering; keep the stored fixes untouched (D-010).
      ⇠ T-058, T-030
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-059)
- [x] **T-060** Accessibility styling pass **in both styles** (D-015, D-026) ⇠ T-059, T-139

      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-061)
- [x] **T-062** Camera defaults and sensible pan/zoom bounds ⇠ T-056
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-062)
- [~] **T-063** Verify cold start renders fully in airplane mode ⇠ T-057
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-063)
- [~] **T-063a** Decide what to do about the four unbundled glyph ranges ⇠ T-063
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-063a)
- [ ] **T-063b** One glyph range is still requested, and the pack carries names in nine scripts
      ⇠ T-063a
      — **Still failing:** `65024-65279 for font stack Noto Sans Medium` (U+FE00–FEFF), twice per
      cold start. **No visible label is broken.** Proved data-dependent, not a renderer quirk: with
      `text-field` replaced by a literal string the request disappears entirely. Which name
      triggers it is *not* identified — a full MVT decode of every `places` string value found
      nothing in that range, so the two facts do not yet reconcile. **Do not guess; the literal
      test is the tool that works.**
      — **The better fix, which removes the cause instead of the symptom:** strip the non-Portuguese
      `name:*` and `pgf:name:*` properties in the tile build. The app is English-only (CONTEXT §1)
      and labels are Portuguese, so nine other scripts are bytes and glyph requests bought for
      nothing — against a 19.1 MB budget (D-035/D-036). That is a `tiles/pipeline` change and needs
      a pack rebuild, which is why it is not done here.
      — Re-check with: `adb logcat -d | grep "glyph range"`.
- [x] ~~**T-063a** original framing~~ — kept below because the reasoning is what stopped the
      expensive reflex:
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-063a)
- [ ] **T-064** Performance test: recolour **the real graph**, not a sample ⇠ T-059
      — **Target corrected 2026-08-08 (T-028).** The old "5,000+ segments" figure was an order of
      magnitude low: Madeira has **~51,000 highway ways** before splitting at intersections. Test
      against the actual island. If T-025a is adopted, all of them render every frame.
- [ ] **T-065** Outdoor sunlight legibility test — **in Funchal, at midday, held at arm's
      length.** This is the test that decides whether D-026's light-for-use choice was right.
      Run it against both styles. ⇠ T-060
- [x] **T-139** Author the **dark** style variant for the souvenir renderer (D-026) — the
      fog-of-war look: dark ground, unvisited legible mid-grey, visited bright and heavy. Shares
      the same tile pack as T-058. Also offered as a user preference (T-140). ⇠ T-058
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-139)
- [x] **T-140** Light/dark preference in settings (D-026). Defaults to light for in-app use;
      the souvenir always renders dark regardless of this setting. ⇠ T-139, T-141

**Milestone M2 — "It looks like Madeira"** ⇠ T-063, T-064, T-065

## Phase 3 — Stamps, geofences and regions

### Content curation

- [~] **T-066** Curate **~80 POIs (target band 60–100, D-049)** on **Madeira only** — hand-verified. Porto Santo POI
      curation is explicitly deferred (D-021) — do not spend effort on it. ⇠ T-015, T-016d
      — ⚠ **A starter set of 80 exists as of 2026-08-14, and it is not this task.** The project
      lead asked for it twice; selection was by prominence and coverage, so the app can be used
      and looked at. **The hand-verification this task is actually about has not happened for a
      single place.** `content/README.md` says how to redo it and what the traps are.
      — What the starter set did prove: the passport at 80 is legible, the artwork survives real
      Portuguese names, and 12 of 80 names are too long for the sticker band (they end in an
      ellipsis; the card carries the full name).
      — **Every place must be assigned exactly one of the five categories** (D-027):
      **Viewpoints · Levadas · Villages · Beaches · Landmarks**. There is deliberately no
      "Other" — if a place fits nowhere, that is a signal about the place, not a missing row.
      — Each place also carries a `region_id`, used by the map screen rather than the passport.
      — Categories live in the content pack, never in `app/` (D-017).
      — **This is selection, not research** (T-028): OSM already offers 569 `tourism=viewpoint`
      nodes, 180 peaks and 79 settlements in the bbox — far more candidates than the 150–250
      target. The work is hand-verification and editorial judgement, which is the one thing a
      global competitor cannot buy (CONTEXT §5a).
      — **Unblocked 2026-08-10 (T-040).** The file to fill in is `content/pois.json`; the format,
      the levada two-geofence rule and the guidance on choosing radii are in
      `content/README.md`; `node tools/validate-content.mjs` checks the work and reports
      progress against the target. Nothing else is waiting on anything.
      — **Made cheaper 2026-08-12: `node tools/poi-candidates.mjs`.** The task always said this
      was *selection, not research* — but there was nothing to select *from*, so it was a blank
      file and a coordinate lookup per place. The tool reads the tile pack already in the repo
      (no download, no new dependency) and writes **~390 candidates** to
      `content/pois.candidates.json`: name, coordinates, suggested category, suggested radius,
      region. Ordered by OSM's `min_zoom` prominence so the ones most likely to matter are first.
      **The work is now deleting, which is a thing a person can finish.**
      — ⚠ **It does not curate and must not** — everything in it is a name, a coordinate and a
      lookup table. It leaves levadas alone (they need a start *and* an end, D-009 — the 33 named
      trailheads are listed separately) and departure points alone (worth getting right by hand).
      — Two mistakes it made on the way, both caught by measuring the output: ranking across
      categories on one scale produced **397 villages, three landmarks and no viewpoints**, and
      deduping on rounded coordinates left pairs "0 m apart" that the validator flagged. Ranking
      is now per-category and dedupe is by name plus 150 m.
- [x] **T-099a** Departure points defined in `content/pois.json` (D-012) — Madeira Airport,
      Porto Santo Airport, Funchal ferry terminal, coordinates from OSM. The validator had been
      warning that **no trip could ever end at an airport**, which is the primary trigger for the
      one moment D-012 calls the best in the product.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-099)

- [x] **T-067** ✅ **Region boundaries, 2026-08-16 — and a third of the pack was in the wrong
      one.** `tools/build-regions.mjs` fetches Madeira's eleven municipalities from OSM
      (`admin_level=7`) into `content/regions.json`, and `--assign` derives each place's
      `regionId` from the polygon it stands in. Decision: **D-061**.
      — ⚠ **`.json`, not the `.geojson` this task asked for.** The contents are GeoJSON; the
      extension is what Metro and TypeScript resolve without a bundler config, which is the same
      reason `levadas.json` has it.
      — **46 of 80 places were misfiled, and nothing could see it**: 27 sat in a region called
      `madeira` — the island had ranked as a settlement in `poi-candidates.mjs`'s nearest-anchor
      heuristic — and 19 more were in a neighbouring municipality. `byRegion` has been computed
      since T-073 and displayed nowhere, so the numbers were never looked at.
      — The card names the municipality on a line under the place's name. That is the whole of
      the UI: a region strip over the map is a T-112 question, not this task's.
      — ⚠ **It went on the status line first, and the workbench said no.** "LEVADA WALK · CÂMARA
      DE LOBOS · COLLECTED" needs 347 px of the 324 the card has at 390 px wide, so the worst
      realistic case wrapped into two lines of tracked capitals above the name — invisible until
      a levada in the longest-named municipality is collected. Measured, not eyeballed (D-038).
      — ⚠ **Two stamps could never have been earned.** The validator now checks each place
      against the boundaries and found Cabo Girão **525 m out to sea** and the Rocha do Navio
      reserve **1.4 km** out. Coordinates are T-066's; this only reports them.
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-067)
- [ ] **T-067a** Porto Santo lock/unlock gate (D-024): hidden from map, region list and UI
      until an island-level geofence fires; unlock is permanent. **The stamp denominator must
      count unlocked regions only**, or the headline number breaks. ⇠ T-039, T-067, T-073
      — **The data half is done (T-067).** Every region in `content/regions.json` carries its
      `islandId`, and `regionPack.ts` parses it: Porto Santo is `porto-santo`, everything else is
      `ilha-da-madeira`. What is missing is the gate — the island-level geofence, the persisted
      unlock, and passing `lockedRegionIds` into `computeTripProgress`, which has taken that
      argument since T-073 and has never been given a non-empty set.
- [~] **T-068** Define levada corridors with entry/exit nodes ⇠ T-028, T-028a
      — **Half done 2026-08-13 (D-055).** `tools/build-levadas.mjs` extracts the named ways of each
      curated levada from Overpass into `content/levadas.json`, applying the rule below —
      `highway=*` preferred, `waterway=*` as the fallback. Simplified for drawing: Levada do Furado
      is 39 ways, 654 → 181 points, **4 kB**. The app draws it when you ask to see the walk.
      — ⚠ **What is done is the *drawing*, not the corridor.** No entry/exit nodes and no
      connectivity check, so trailhead-to-exit crediting (D-009, T-089) still has nothing to stand
      on. That is the half this task is really about, and it is v2 work after D-032.
      — ⚠ **The name is the weak point, and a mismatch is a curation signal.** The tool matches OSM
      exactly first, then by prefix (for `(PR10)` suffixes), and prints each course's span in km —
      a course "60 km across" is two levadas sharing a word, which is what a loose regex produced
      on the first run. `Levada dos Balcões` matched nothing at all; until T-066 resolves the
      spelling, that card shows a marker and no course.
      — **Select by name (`Levada*`) plus hiking-relation membership, never by a single tag**
      (D-029). A levada is two parallel ways sharing one name: the channel (usually
      `waterway=drain`, 2,357 ways) and the footpath beside it (usually `highway=path`, 922).
      Use the `highway=*` ways for matching — the user walks the path, not the channel — and fall
      back to `waterway=*` geometry where a channel is mapped but no path is.
      — **Verify corridor connectivity.** A gap mid-corridor silently breaks trailhead-to-exit
      crediting, which is the mechanic levadas depend on (D-009).
- [ ] **T-069** Extract tunnel portal pairs from OSM into `content/tunnels.geojson` ⇠ T-022
      — **Must cover walkable tunnels, not just road tunnels.** 108 of the 604 tunnel ways are
      levada tunnels (T-028) — zero GPS, on foot, which is exactly the T-089/T-090 case.
- [x] **T-070** Commission or produce stamp artwork ⇠ T-066
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-070)

### Mechanics

- [x] **T-071** Stamp award rules: dwell time **and** plausible speed gates (D-009) ⇠ T-041,
      T-066
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-071)
- [x] **T-072** Store a confidence value on every stamp award ⇠ T-071
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-072)

      — **Consumed by the map screen, not the passport** (D-027). It does the "where should I go
      next" job that D-002 needs it for. Denominator counts **unlocked regions only** (D-024).
- [x] **T-074** Passport (stamp collection) screen ⇠ T-070, T-071, T-072a
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-074)
      — **Extended 2026-08-14 (D-058):** it lists **every** curated place, not only the collected
      ones. Uncollected are drawn muted, are tappable, and *Show on map* works for them — so the
      passport is now the discovery surface as well as the reward surface. This is what closes the
      hole D-052 left when the map's place markers were deleted.
- [x] **T-075** Primary screen: map, plus **three controls only** ⇠ T-015, T-073, T-074
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-075)

### Verification

- [ ] **T-076** Verify the geofence set reshuffles correctly while crossing the island
      ⇠ T-039, T-066
      — **Does not need T-066 to start.** The debug screen's *Start geofence field test*
      button generates a synthetic catalogue around wherever you are standing, sized so the
      platform's region cap binds and the anchor lands at roughly 850 m — a five-minute walk.
      Walk that far and the diary should show a `geofence` rebuild with a different set.
      — This is what sets the three guessed constants in **D-033**. Note the delivery *lateness*
      of the anchor exit at driving speed, not just that it arrived.
- [~] **T-077** Verify a stamp fires reliably on arrival at a miradouro ⇠ T-071
      — **The emulator half is done 2026-08-14, and it was worth doing**: it is what uncovered
      T-145. First stamp ever awarded — Forte de São Tiago — via a route that arrives and stands
      still (`tools/routes/forte-sao-tiago-dwell.txt`).
      — ⚠ **Confidence 0.60, through the `no speed data` branch, not the two-gate pass.** The
      emulator serves nothing once you stop moving (D-047), so the arrival case cannot be
      verified properly here. **The field half is untouched.**
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-077)
- [ ] **T-078** Verify driving past a levada trailhead does **not** award it ⇠ T-071
- [ ] **T-079** Verify stamps still award with GPS accuracy degraded to 100m ⇠ T-071
- [ ] **T-080** Verify geofencing battery cost is not measurable above baseline ⇠ T-076

## Phase 4 — Map matching and road highlighting

> ## ⛔ DEFERRED TO v2 — D-032 (2026-08-08)
>
> **Do not build any of this for v1.** v1 draws the **raw GPS trace** instead of matching it to
> road segments. This is the single largest body of work in the project, in service of something
> D-002 already calls *decoration* — while the actual reward (stamps) comes from geofences, which
> need almost no accuracy.
>
> **Deferring costs nothing permanent.** D-010 retains raw traces immutably, so matching can be
> added in v2 and run **retroactively over every trip already recorded**. That is precisely the
> property D-010 was written to buy.
>
> Everything from T-082 to T-098 below is v2. Left in place, unrenumbered, with dependencies
> intact.

### Graph and core matching

- [ ] **T-082** Import the road/path graph into SQLite with an R-tree spatial index ⇠ T-022,
      T-030
      — Scale, measured 2026-08-08 (T-028): **~51,000 highway ways** before splitting at
      intersections.
      — **Open question to settle here, not in an implementer's head: do footways belong in the
      graph?** There are **16,066**, overwhelmingly Funchal pavements. Including them makes the
      city a mass of pavement fragments, inflates any denominator they touch, and adds matching
      ambiguity exactly where GPS is already multipathed by buildings. Excluding them is probably
      right. Decide explicitly and record it.
- [ ] **T-083** Snap-to-segment matching using heading, speed and **altitude** ⇠ T-082, T-035
- [ ] **T-084** Hysteresis to prevent flicker between vertically stacked roads (VR1 vs ER101)
      ⇠ T-083
- [ ] **T-085** Wide match corridor for paths — 50–75m vs 15–25m for roads ⇠ T-083
- [ ] **T-086** Movement-bout segmentation using activity type and speed ⇠ T-034, T-083

### Generous crediting (D-009)

- [ ] **T-087** Tunnel portal inference — portal A then portal B credits the whole tunnel
      ⇠ T-069, T-083
- [ ] **T-088** Shortest-path gap bridging with plausibility checks (starting thresholds:
      <~30 min, <~15 km). Must **not** attempt to credit a road route across the Porto Santo
      ferry crossing (D-021). ⇠ T-082, T-083
- [ ] **T-089** Levada corridor crediting — trailhead + exit credits the whole walk ⇠ T-068
- [ ] **T-090** Sensor-only fallback — trailhead + step count + elevation profile ⇠ T-036,
      T-035, T-089
- [ ] **T-091** Store `confidence` and `credit_method` on every visited_segment ⇠ T-083

### Execution and verification

- [ ] **T-092** Burst matching scheduler — runs on idle or charge, never per-fix ⇠ T-086
- [ ] **T-093** Re-runnable matching over stored raw traces ⇠ T-092, T-016
- [ ] **T-094** Matching regression harness running against the Phase 0 fixtures ⇠ T-021,
      T-083
- [ ] **T-095** Verify a tunnel drive is credited with zero fixes inside it ⇠ T-087, T-094
- [ ] **T-096** Verify a canopy-blackout levada is credited end to end ⇠ T-089, T-090, T-094
- [ ] **T-097** Verify the VR1 and the coastal road are never confused ⇠ T-084, T-094
- [ ] **T-098** Verify burst matching over a full day has no noticeable battery cost ⇠ T-092

**Milestone M4 — "The map fills in"** ⇠ T-095, T-096, T-097, T-098 — **v2 milestone (D-032)**

## Phase 5 — The souvenir

- [x] **T-099** Trip-end detection via airport geofence, plus Porto Santo airport and the
      Funchal cruise terminal ⇠ T-039, T-014
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-099)
- [x] **T-100** Fallback trip-end detection — left island bounding box, or 24h+ no data.
      **Must treat Madeira and Porto Santo as a single region (D-021)**, otherwise a day trip
      to Porto Santo falsely ends the trip. ⇠ T-099
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-100)
- [x] **T-101** Finalisation pass — run any pending matching before the reveal ⇠ T-092, T-099
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-101)
- [x] **T-102** Reveal notification at the departure-lounge moment ⇠ T-099
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-102)
- [x] **T-103** Accommodation detection — identify the most frequent overnight location
      ⇠ T-030
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-103)
- [x] **T-104** Accommodation masking applied by default to all exports (D-016) ⇠ T-103
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-104)
- [ ] **T-105** On-device 9:16 vertical video renderer — animated trace draw-on, stamps
      popping in collection order, camera flyover ⇠ T-059, T-074
      — **Split 2026-08-11 into T-105a and T-105b (D-042).** The composition is arithmetic and
      testable today; the encoder is not verifiable without a device. Same split as
      `stampRules`/`stampAwards`. T-105 stays open as the parent until T-105b closes.

- [~] **T-105b** **MOVED TO v2 2026-08-12 (D-051).** Encode the storyboard to an MP4 ⇠ T-105a
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-105b)
- [ ] **T-105c** Research an on-device video encoder, and what it talks to ⇠ D-051
      — The project lead asked for this explicitly: *"definitely something we should research in
      the future"*. Deliverable is a recommendation with a **network-behaviour audit** per D-043 —
      the thing that turns "no data leaves the device" quietly false (CONTEXT §4.8).
- [x] ~~**T-105d** Make the passport worth screenshotting~~ **DROPPED 2026-08-12 by the project
      lead**, the day after it was raised. ⇠ T-074, D-051
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-105d)
- [ ] **T-105b-v2** Encode the storyboard to an MP4 on the device ⇠ T-105a, T-105c *(v2)*
      — Needs native video encoding, which is the part that cannot be verified without a
      device. It consumes `Composition` and needs no judgement of its own.
      — Also where the *look* is decided: whether the finale shows a denominator (D-042 carries
      both numbers deliberately), and whether the guessed durations survive being watched.

## Phase 6 — Simplicity, accessibility and compliance

### UX reduction

- [~] **T-112** Ruthless UI reduction pass — one primary screen, one hero number ⇠ T-075
      — **Started 2026-08-13, from screenshots rather than from reading the code.** Three things
      the running app was doing that no test could see: a LogBox toast for the known T-063b glyph
      error sat **on top of the passport button** (a tap opened a red error page instead of the
      passport); the passport's stamps were 62 dp postage stamps in mostly-empty cards; and empty
      category rows were full-height grey slabs. Now: the known error is silenced by its exact
      text, stamps are 96 dp, and an empty row is a slim outline.
      — The rest of T-112 still stands.
      — Target is already set by `docs/design-brief.md` §3: map plus three controls. Watch
      specifically for banner/promo cards accumulating over the map; the reference app loses the
      top third of its map to two stacked dismissible banners.
- [x] **T-113** Tap targets 60dp minimum, high contrast, large type throughout ⇠ T-112
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-113)
- [x] **T-114** Minimal plain-English onboarding, no jargon ⇠ T-042
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-114)
- [x] **T-115** Landmark tap → minimal card (name, photo, distance, one Directions button
      handing off to Apple/Google Maps). No in-app navigation. (D-018) ⇠ T-066
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-115). Decision: **D-052**.
      — ⚠ **No photo, and no distance in the common case.** The content pack has no photo field;
      the distance is withheld unless the recorder has a fix under 30 minutes old.
      — ⚠ **Revised the same day by the project lead:** the map no longer draws every place. The
      route to a place is **passport → tap a stamp → card → Show on map** (D-052 revised).
      — **Emulator-checked, with screenshots**, against a temporary fixture pack: the stamp opens
      its card, *Show on map* flies the camera to the trailhead and marks it, and Directions
      launched Google Maps. The `geo:` fallback and iOS are still unverified.
- [x] **T-116** Cap notifications at two per trip (D-011) ⇠ T-049, T-102
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-116)
- [x] **T-116a** Move the island's name out of the reveal notification (D-017) ⇠ T-102
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-116a)

### Privacy and compliance

- [x] **T-117** **Dependency network audit** — confirm zero SDKs transmit anything. This is
      where these apps actually leak. ⇠ T-029
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-117)
- [ ] **T-117b** **Confirm zero outbound connections on a real device** — packet capture during
      the T-051 soak, where it costs nothing extra to watch. Specifically: no FCM registration
      (D-043), no `exp.host`, no asset CDN, no tile requests. ⇠ T-117, T-051
- [ ] **T-117a** **Confirm the development scaffolding is inert in a release build.** Distinct
      from T-117, which is about network behaviour and would not look at this. Two things to
      check: the `expo-dev-client` permissions (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`,
      `READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`) are absent, and the synthetic POI
      fixture cannot run — `app/index.ts` only wraps the catalogue in
      `withDevFixtureFallback` when `__DEV__`, and shipping a ring of invented geofences around
      the user would be absurd. ⇠ T-029
      — **A third thing to check, measured in the debug APK 2026-08-12:** `expo-dev-launcher`
      contributes **ML Kit barcode scanning** — `lib/*/libbarhopper_v3.so` at 5.9 MB plus
      `assets/mlkit_barcode_models/*.tflite` at 0.78 MB. It is there for the dev server's QR
      scanner. Expected to vanish in release along with the rest of the dev client, but it is a
      *camera-adjacent, model-carrying* dependency on an app whose entire pitch is that nothing
      leaves the device, so confirm its absence explicitly rather than by assumption — this is
      exactly the class T-117 was written to catch (CONTEXT §4.8).
- [x] **T-118** iOS `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` manifest, including third-party SDK declarations
      ⇠ T-117
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-118)
- [ ] **T-119** iOS purpose strings for While-Using and Always ⇠ T-042, T-043

- [ ] **T-123** Google Play background-location review submission with demonstration video and
      written justification ⇠ T-121, T-122
- [x] **T-124** Privacy policy (short, because there is genuinely nothing to disclose) ⇠ T-117
      — Notes: `docs/task-notes.md` (T-124)

      T-113
- [ ] **T-127** Network monitor shows zero outbound requests over a full simulated trip
      ⇠ T-117
- [ ] **T-128** Both store privacy declarations verified truthful ⇠ T-120, T-122

- [ ] **T-132** Collect and act on beta feedback ⇠ T-129
- [ ] **T-133** Store listing — screenshots, copy, preview video ⇠ M6
- [ ] **T-134** Verify ≥10 real week-long trips recorded end to end with no tracking failure
      ⇠ T-129
- [ ] **T-135** Verify no beta tester reports a missing levada or a false stamp ⇠ T-132

      the distribution hypothesis under test — D-013) ⇠ T-132
- [ ] **T-137** Submit to both stores ⇠ T-133, T-134
- [ ] **T-138** Launch ⇠ T-137

**Milestone M7 — Launched** ⇠ T-138

## Critical path

The longest dependency chain, and therefore the schedule driver:

```
T-013 (framework) ✅ RESOLVED — React Native
  → T-029 (scaffold) → T-031 (expo-location) → T-039 (geofence manager)
  → T-071 (stamp rules) → T-075 (primary screen) → T-112 (UI reduction)
  → T-123 (Play background-location review)  ← slow, external, budget generously
  → T-129 (beta) → T-137 (submit) → T-138 (launch)
```

Two items sit on the critical path and are **outside our control**: the Google Play
background-location review (T-123) and the real-world beta (T-129), which requires people to
actually go to Madeira for a week. Start both as early as possible.

**No longer a gate:** `T-024` (stable OSM way IDs in tiles) was previously the project's
critical decision gate. **D-022 retired it** — visited segments are drawn from our own local
geometry, so nothing depends on addressing tile features at runtime.
